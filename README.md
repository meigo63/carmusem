<p>The Ford Model T is an automobile that was produced by the Ford Motor Company from October 1, 1908, to May 26, 1927.[16] It is generally regarded as the first mass-affordable automobile, which made car travel available to middle-class Americans.[17] The relatively low price was partly the result of Ford's efficient fabrication, including assembly line production instead of individual handcrafting.[18] The savings from mass production allowed the price to decline from $780 in 1910 (equivalent to $25,506 in 2023) to $290 in 1924 ($5,156 in 2023 dollars[19]).[20] It was mainly designed by three engineers, Joseph A. Galamb (the main engineer),[21][22] Eugene Farkas, and Childe Harold Wills. The Model T was colloquially known as the "Tin Lizzie".</p>
